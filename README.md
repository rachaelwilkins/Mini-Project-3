The third mini-project is designed to cover material learned in modules 8 and 9 around using databases. The goal is to create a real-time database after fetching data externally via an API (choose from the list or find your own). The project should follow the MVC model, and ideally include a start-up routine that initially fetches the data and populates the database. All CRUD operations should be included, and demonstrated via Postman or Swagger (a front-end is not required). The database structure should reflect the structure of the data returned from the external API, but does not need to include everything.
